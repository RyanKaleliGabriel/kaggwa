## Regreening Senegal

![](images/drs_banner_senegal.jpg)

The Regrenning App was developed to help farmers, extension agents, NGOs, and other stakeholders to track land restoration interventions. In Senegal, the app is primarily used to assess and monitor Farmer Managed Natural Regeneration (FMNR) and other regreening activities.

As shown in the map below (@fig-fmnr_map), the app has been used to document the location of FMNR sites across the country. The data collected through the app is used to monitor the progress of regreening activities and to assess the impact of these interventions on the environment and local communities.

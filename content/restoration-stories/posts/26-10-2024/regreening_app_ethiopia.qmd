## Regreening Ethiopia

![](images/ethiopia_landscape.jpg)

In Ethiopia, Farmer Managed Natural Regeneration (FMNR). The app was developed by the World Agroforestry Centre (ICRAF) and the World Vision Ethiopia team. It is used by lead farmers and implementing partners to collect data on the location of trees, the species of trees, and the number of trees planted.

As shown in the map below (@fig-fmnr_map), the app has been used to document the location of FMNR sites across the country. The data collected through the app is used to monitor the progress of regreening activities and to assess the impact of these interventions on the environment and local communities.

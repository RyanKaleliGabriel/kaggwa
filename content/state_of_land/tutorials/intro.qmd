## Welcome!

The K4GGWA Tutorials hub explains, in plain language, how spatial data underpins
K4GGWA’s work on land health and restoration across the Great Green Wall.

This first module focuses on spatial data **foundations**. It is designed for decision-makers,
practitioners, and analysts who want to understand what the maps show and how to
use them effectively.

Later modules will provide **hands-on workflows** in R, Python, and Google Earth Engine,
linked to example notebooks and datasets.

Let's get started!

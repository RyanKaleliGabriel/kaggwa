# ~ Team script storage ~

Purpose: centralised storage for scripts used to produce web maps throughout the report, for reusability etc

# How to add:

1. Create a folder under a section:
   `analysis/climate/precipitation/`

2. Add your scripts and a `notes.md` with:
   - What script does
   - Inputs - links/paths (STAC url or other)
   - Outputs - files written to `assets/maps/data/`
   - How to run: commands/env

# other notes:
    - One folder per analysis, author initials + year.
    - Keep outputs web-ready (GeoJSON/TopoJSON/COG).
